# Code Study Project Introduction
Hello everyone! Lately I've been working on my code learning project, however, due to my poor coding abiliy, some of them could not actually run properly, so if you can fix it, please contact me at grandtheftauto710@outlook.com, I am looking forward to your reply. Thanks a lot!

# Lately Update
I update the PythonLearning.py and Python_CookBook.py, but now it still have a bunch of problems, the first is in python_sookbook.py, on line 1413 to line 1514, I don't know why that the VS Code continue reported me about "permutation error" same as the PythonLearning.py. And apprently, the code which in the  pythonlearning.py has some loop that just won't stop(I cna only comment it out temporarily to let the program run later). So if any know how to solve this problem, please email me at 1789216340lhy@gmail.com Thanks a lot!

# A poem for you
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
f the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
